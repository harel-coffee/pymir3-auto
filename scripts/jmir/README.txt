The scripts in the jmir folder were built to allow easier access to data
generated by the jMIR project. The jMIR project is available at:

   http://jmir.sourceforge.net/

The problem we found (this is 2015, June 17th) is that jSymbolic saves in a
particular XML format. It contains all information we want, but we would like to
have CSV or tabular files, so they can be imported into our favourite programs
for data analysis.
